Comprehensive sex education and access to contraception are vital in helping teenagers make informed choices about their reproductive health.     It's crucial to provide support and resources for pregnant teenagers to ensure they receive proper prenatal care and guidance.

Friendship is a complex and multifaceted relationship that involves more than just demonstrating friendliness.     Being friendly can be an essential initial step in building a friendship, but it is not the sole criterion.     True friendships require mutual trust, shared interests, and emotional connection, in addition to friendliness.     Friendships can develop from various starting points, including shared experiences, common goals, or genuine understanding.     The ability to be a good friend also includes qualities like loyalty, empathy, and support, which go beyond initial friendliness.

Procedures should provide a framework, but individuals may need to use their discretion when following them to achieve the desired outcome.     Overly complex or outdated procedures may necessitate some level of adaptation for efficiency and effectiveness.     It's important to strike a balance between adhering to procedures and being flexible when circumstances warrant it.     Deviations should be justified, well-documented, and a subject of continuous improvement to enhance procedures when necessary.	agree	agree	agree	agree	agree	1	2	0	1	7

I disagree with the statement that you should always tell someone if their partner is manipulating them.     While manipulation in a relationship is concerning, there are situations where immediate disclosure may not be the best course of action.     It's important to consider the individual's readiness to hear such information and the potential consequences, including their emotional well-being and safety.     Encouraging open and non-judgmental communication with the affected person can often be a good initial step.     In some cases, professional help or support services may be more appropriate, especially if manipulation poses a serious risk.     Privacy and autonomy are crucial, and one should respect the person's right to make decisions about their relationship.     Deciding whether to inform someone about manipulation should be based on careful consideration of the circumstances and a genuine concern for their well-being.	agree	agree	agree	agree	disagree	1	3	0	1	7

The intention behind the gift matters; if it's meant to be a harmless prank or a joke, it may not be considered mean.     Some people appreciate the thought and effort put into creating a fictional or humorous gift.     It's essential to consider the recipient's personality and preferences; what might be mean to one person could be amusing to another.     Clear communication and understanding between the giver and the recipient can help ensure that the gift is taken in the intended spirit and not seen as mean-spirited.	agree	disagree	agree	disagree	agree	1	2	0	1	6
